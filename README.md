Developed a comprehensive Face Detection Attendance System that combines real-time facial recognition with essential administrative tools such as inventory management. The primary system uses OpenCV for detecting and recognizing faces to automate attendance processes, replacing traditional manual methods. An intuitive GUI was built using Tkinter to guide users through entry and exit operations, while attendance data is securely stored and managed using SQLite.
To enhance system utility and administrative control, an integrated Inventory Management module was developed using Python and Microsoft SQL Server. This module allows tracking and managing resources such as office supplies or educational materials linked to attendance or staff usage.
